## React Jobly

React app revisiting Jobly, a previous job-board project. Jobly originally worked with just a back-end, and this project aims to add a front-end via React.

Prior to deployment, `npm i` should be run, and a `jobly` database should be seeded via `jobly.sql`. PostGreSQL (PSQL) is recommended for this.
This is done via `psql -f jobly.sql`.

Run app using `npm run start`.
